## Our Blackjack Game House Rules

1. The deck is unlimited in size.
2. There are no jokers.
3. The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
4. The Ace can count as 11 or 1.

Use the following list as the deck of cards:

cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
The computer is the dealer.
